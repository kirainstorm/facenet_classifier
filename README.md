Facenet C++ Classifier
====================
- This is C++ implementation of the Facenet classifier for the Facenet project by David Sandberg https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet
- Part of the Tensor Flow code has been taken from https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/issues/357 and https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/8033
- Preprocessing of Images is done using code posted by knighthappy on https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/issues/357
- It has been compiled & run using OpenCV 3.3.0 and Tensor Flow 1.4.0 on Fedora 26 x86_64

Usage
====================
- ./classify <TRAIN|CLASSIFY>  <Path/To/TensorFlowModel> <Path/To/Image/Directory/Structure> <Path/To/Classifier/Model> <Classifier/Class/Labels> <SVM|KNN|MLP>
- Directory structure should be <class_name>/<image_files>
- Face Images Should be 160x160

Issues
====================
- More Testing Needed
- Results are good with more than one input image given to the pre-trained model.

Instructions to compile Tensor Flow C++ shared library
